# Blam

Blam is a text snippet manager. It manages your text snippets. From the command line.
It's totally inspired by [Boom](http://github.com/holman/boom). However, as you may know, Boom is written in Ruby.
Being far too self-righteous to use something written in Ruby, however awesome it may be, I decided to port it to Python.
It was mostly an exercise in my hacking ability - I wanted to see if I could write something useful without access to the internet.
So when the time came for a 7 hour car ride from Philly to Hatteras Island, I grabbed what was left of my summer reading and my trusty old MBP.
As a result of my limited (zero) internet access when the majority of the code was written, it's very hacky. Most things are probably done entirely the wrong way. But it works.
Anyway, that's my spiel. Have fun. Use protection.
